*Description*
*Task*: To extract text from an image of handwritten text. 
*Strategy*: Using python tesseract to accomplish the task.
Step 1: Downloading Tesseract OCR in the system. 
Step 2: Setting up path tesseract in the system.
Step 3: Downloading packages for the task i.e. open cv, pytesseract
Step 4: Creating a python file and uploading the image.
Step 5: Importing all the important libraries i.e. pytesseract, cv2
Step 6: Using gray scaling for image processing to simplify image from multi-channel to single-channel repersentation
        making it easier for OCR engine to process and analyse image more efficiently
Step 7: Using noise reduction to minimize the loss of important details (eg. edges or textures)
Step 8: Using Threshold to convert grayscale image to binary image by setting threhold values for black and white pixels.
Step 9: Running the code using pytesseract
